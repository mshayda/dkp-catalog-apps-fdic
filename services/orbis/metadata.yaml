  ## About NDT AI
  Non-Destructive Testing is a tedious process wherein a certified inspector evaluates radiographic images of welds to determine the quality of the weld. The NDT inspector will mark any rejectable defect areas; this includes pores, cracks, slag, etc. Defect identification and classification are not only prone to error, they are refutable interpretations. Inspectors rely on more than just their absolute training; they use heuristics and intuition to draw their final conclusionsâ€”this is where most of the error happens.
